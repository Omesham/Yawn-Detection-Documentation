				ANACONDA INSTALLATION FOR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

			</h2>


			<p>
				<b>Step 1: </b>

				Download Anaconda: click link <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution> Anaconda Download</a>

				Click on get additional installers for other operating system options


			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Step 2: </b>
				Click on the executable file and install Anaconda, select the path where you want it installed and click next and follow the installation
				process prompts.It takes some time so don't panic.<br><br>


				<b>Step 3: </b>
				Go to directory or folder where it is installed, you should see Anaconda3 directory/folder created by the installation. <br><br>
				<b>Step 4: </b> (Set up environment)<br><br>
				<b>Step 5: </b> (Copy required directory paths and add new environment)<br><br>
				Now copy the Anaconda File Path, click on your start menu and search for "environment"

			</p>

			<img src="C:\Users\DTS-Loaner\Pictures\environment search.jpg" alt="Env">
			<p>
				<b>Step 6: </b>
				Open environment window and add these directories paths as seen in the image below.<br><br>

			</p>

		</div>

          <div>
		  
		  	<p>
				<b>Step 7: </b>
				Now launch your anaconda terminal:click start menu and search for "Anaconda" 
				open terminal and tpe the command to create an environment to install necessary packages because you can't install these packages in your base directory <br>
		         <span style="color:red">NOTE!</span>  The packages need this environment you are about to create to work with your packages,
					when you shut down your terminal you will always be required to activate your environment to use these packages so make sure to remember 
					your environment or type " conda env list " without the doube quote to show list of environments 
					env to show your environment <br><br>
				
				<b>Step 8: </b> (create environment)
				
				Type command: conda create -n myenv  (myenv is whatever name you give your environment) and hit enter
				
				copy or type conda activate myenv  (to activate environment)
				
				see image below

			</p>
		  
		    <img src="C:\Users\DTS-Loaner\Pictures\c.jpg"alt="Activate env">
			
			
			
		  </div>

          <div>
		     <p>
			 
			 <b>Step 9: </b><br><br> 
			 
			 Run these commands to install conda packages the necessary packages you need are 
				a. dlib<br><br> b. python <br><br> c.numpy <br><br> d.opencv <br><br> e. jupyter notebook <br><br>
				
			 Now if in the future you want to activate more packages in this environment , activate the environment ( conda activate myenv and repeat these processes)<br><br>
			 
			 
			 <b>Step 10: </b><br><br> 
			 
			 Type commands and hit enter, type y to continue always 
			 
			 commands:
			 
			 conda update conda
			 
			 conda update anaconda
			 
			 conda install -c conda-forge dlib <br><br>conda install -c conda-forge python<br><br>conda install -c conda-forge numpy <br><br>
			 conda install -c conda-forge opencv-python <br><br>  conda install -c conda-forge jupyter notebook <br><br>
			 
			 <b>Step 11: </b>
			 After installing packages 
			 
			 Type jupter notebook to launch jupyter notebook.
			 
			 You can run your code on jupyter notebook now. 
			 
			 The code will execute and launch 2 window frames, one for you face landmarks and the other the live webcam where you can yawn and it counts it.
			 
			 Now I hardcoded my lip distance, feel free to play with this figure to adjust sensitivity level, because you don't want it to count when 
			 you're talking as a Yawn.
